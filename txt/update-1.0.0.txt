**Change log v1.0.0**
```Note: this is mostly copy of the command "update" at this time.```

**ServerSMP - BOT [ MEGA UPDATE ]**
`ServerSMP - BOT` has updated to `discord.js v13` and a lot of changes happened.

**Pros**
1. The bot is easy to use.
2. And is better on my site. `Future me: what did I mean?`

**Cons**
1. All data will be deleted for `welcome`, `xp`.
2. Some databases where changed so the old data will be deleted.

> ```Note: the reason why I had to delete the xp data was because when a user leaves a server then anoter user uses -lp it would fail and crash the bot.```
> ```AKA: discord.js v13 will crash to any error, wich is probalbly caused by nodejs.```
